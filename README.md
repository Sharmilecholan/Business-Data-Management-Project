## 🧩 Project Summary

This project investigates key inefficiencies at **Dynamic Hydraulic Services**, a hydraulic manifold manufacturing firm in Chennai. Using real-world operational data, it identifies and analyzes:

- 🔧 High rework and rejection rates  
- 📉 Unstable costing and hidden profit leaks  
- ⏱️ Sporadic delivery delays and lack of delay tracking  

The goal is to deliver data-driven, actionable insights that enhance **quality control, costing accuracy, and delivery reliability** using modern business data analytics.
